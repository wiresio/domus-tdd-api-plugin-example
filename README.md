# Domus TDD API Plugin Example

This is an example project to present how to develop a TDD-API plugin.
This plugin does not do anything except implementing the basic features
to have a functional plugin.

## Important steps

First, specify into the [`setup.py`](setup.py) the plugins entrypoints regarding
what needs to be added to the TDD server that will add your plugin.
Here we have:

```python
setup(
    ...
    entry_points={
        "tdd_api.plugins.blueprints": [
            "example=tdd_api_plugin_example:blueprint",
        ],
        "tdd_api.plugins.transformers": [
            "example=tdd_api_plugin_example.example:td_to_example",
        ],
    },
)
```

We have defined two entrypoints. The first one is `tdd_api.plugins.blueprints` which is used to
define where to find the [Flask blueprint](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/blueprints/) for
the plugin.
The second one is `tdd_api.plugins.transformers` to specify the function to use to transform a TD to
what you want, here an `example`.

## Blueprint

As we defined in the [`tdd_api_plugin_example/__init__.py`](tdd_api_plugin_example/__init__.py) we define the blueprint
as follow:

```python
blueprint = Blueprint("tdd_api_plugin_example", __name__, url_prefix="/example")
```

We could have name the variable as we prefere since we have defined in the `setup.py` the right
variable name in the entrypoint.

The first parameter `"tdd_api_plugin_example"` is the name of the blueprint, the second parameter is the
import module (here `__name__` since this is the same module) and we define a `url_prefix` to not redeclare it
on each route.
This `url_prefix` will be what distinguish the plugin routes to other. Be sure to not redefine an already imported
prefix.

This blueprint can be used to define all the routes you want to add to the TDD-API server regarding to
this plugin.
For example to add a `GET` route for the `Example` plugin you can add the route like this:

```python
@blueprint.route("/<id>", methods=["GET"])
def describe_example(id):
    return ...
```

We use the blueprint as decorator to add the route, the path is defined regarding the `url_prefix` and we
specify a dedicated method to match.
You can look at the [`tdd_api_plugin_example/__init__.py`](tdd_api_plugin_example/__init__.py) file to see
other examples.

## Transformer

We have defined a transformer to be sure, each time a TD is uploaded to transform it to our `Example` format
and store in the SparqlEndpoint. To do, we declare the function to use in the entrypoint (here
`tdd_api_plugin_example.example:td_to_example` since we use the function `td_to_example` which is define in the
`tdd_api_plugin_example/example.py` file.

This method is declared like this:

```python
def td_to_example(uri):
    ...
```

The parameter must be only the TD URI as a string since we want to be the most generic as possible. Then the first
thing to do can be fetching the TD content, which can be done with:

```python
content = get_id_description(uri, "application/n-triples", {"prefix": "td"})
```

Using this content we can do whatever is needed to transform one format to another.
Then we can store the result using the helper method `put_json_in_sparql` or `put_rdf_in_sparql` from the
`tdd.common` module.
You can look at the [`tdd_api_plugin_example/example.py`](tdd_api_plugin_example/example.py) file to see how it
is defined.

## Tests

This example plugin come with some tests example to present how it can be done.
You can find it in the folder [`tdd_api_plugin_example/tests`](tdd_api_plugin_example/tests).
The `test_example.py` define some tests for the `example.py` module, where the `test_td_to_example.py`
define tests for the routes.

These tests simulate the existence of a real SparqlEndpoint using a RDFLib Graph abstraction. Then you
can specify a mock SparqlEndpoint prefilled with some data as it is defined with:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_sparql_example_and_td(httpx_mock):
    graph = SparqlGraph("td_example.trig", format="trig", data_path=DATA_PATH)
    httpx_mock.add_callback(graph.custom)
```

Where `DATA_PATH` is where the tests data are stored and `td_example.trig` the data to fill the SparqlEndpoint.

There are some generic mock defined in the `TDD-API` module. You have to import them to use them in your tests.
You can find for example the `mock_sparql_empty_endpoint` from `tdd.tests.conftest` module. This mock can be used
to simulate an empty SparqlEndpoint at the begining of your test.
